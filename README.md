This repository contains a JavaScript application designed to facilitate interactions between a ticketing system's front-end and the Ethereum blockchain. Utilizing either Web3.js or Ethers.js, it establishes a connection to Ethereum, enabling users to perform actions such as buying and transferring tickets through smart contract functions directly from the user interface. The application is engineered to dynamically update the UI in response to user transactions, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience. Comprehensive error handling mechanisms are implemented to ensure robustness, while user feedback features are integrated to provide real-time transaction status updates, thereby enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
